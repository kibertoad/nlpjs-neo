# @nlpjs-neo/lang-th

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- aad1f0d: Convert every package to ESM only
  
  The packages are now published as ES modules with no CommonJS build. `require()` of any
  `@nlpjs-neo/*` package, of `node-nlp-neo` or of `node-nlp-rn` no longer works; import them
  instead, or use a dynamic `import()` from CommonJS.
  
  - Every package declares `"type": "module"` and an `exports` map pointing at `./src/index.js`.
  - The minimum supported Node.js version is now 22.12, the first release where `require()` can
    load an ES module. Plugins passed to `containerBootstrap` by path are still loaded
    synchronously, through `createRequire`, and a plugin file that has a single default export is
    unwrapped so it keeps behaving like the CommonJS `module.exports = Plugin` it replaces.
  - Bot resources loaded by `FullBot` (actions, validators and cards) are now read with dynamic
    `import()`. A file with only a default export is unwrapped the same way.
  - `@nlpjs-neo/core` exported a `loadEnv` binding its helper never defined, so it was always
    `undefined`; it now exports `loadEnvFromJson`, which is what the helper provides and what
    `@nlpjs-neo/core-loader` expects.
